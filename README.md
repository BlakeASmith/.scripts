# .scripts
Various scripts which I use on my system


## Installation

To install these scripts simply run [./install_scripts.sh](install_scripts.sh)

For an even easier install using `curl`: 

```bash
source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlakeASmith/.scripts/main/one_shot_install.sh)
```

This will place the source for the scripts under `~/.scripts` and also move all executibles to `~/.local/bin`
